# NeuralNetwork
Configurable NeuralNetwork implementation using Java

# Purpose
Neural Network includes documentation in doc folder. To use it, you have to write you own main file. Example is given in src/app/Application.java

You can adjust the size and amount of layers. You also have the possibility of creating a neural network trainer which trains your NN (Neural Network) to a given input.

# Current development
As of now, the NN will be extended by image recognition. So far the project is still in development phase.

# Future features / TODO

* The NN should implement an overhead API for use on a server.
* Support multiple backpropagation algorithms
